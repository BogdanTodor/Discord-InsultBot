# Discord-InsultBot
This is just a simple discord bot that makes sarcastic comments or insults based on the message contents or who sent the message. The project was done to test and have fun with the discord api.


If you wanted to use the bot code, just replace the string contents outlined in the .py file with whatever insults you like. 
The code for each type of message can be copy pasted and reused for different purposes. 
This does require discord.py and the default discord bot processes be followed in order to work.

Functionality:
Once introduced into the server of your choice. Just run the script and leave it active.
